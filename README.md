QBERT, the classic arcade game that later become a staple of the Atari console, lay before you in the form of a beautiful marraige between java and processing. The game is a platformer with puzzle elements as you must control your orange protaganist who spawns at the top of the pyramid and must make his way to every other platform lighting them up as he goes.

After late nights of migrain-inducing thinking, we have come to the conclusion that Qbert's feet are magical. The gravitational force brought out by Qbert's outstanding jumps leads to a collision that forces the color of the ground beneath him to change. You begin at the top and must jump on every other platform and yes that includes your spawn platform!

You jump from platform to platform using the q,w,a, and s keys. Q will make Qbert jump to the platform on his upper left. W will make him jump to that which is on his upper right. A will make him jump to his lower left platform. S will make him jump to the lower right one. Qbert cannot jump off the game because he is our protaginist and our beloved comarade.

Level 1
Qbert faces the demon which is Coily. Coily is a venomous snake that will demolish Qbert if they ever share the same ground. Coily is cute and fuzzy from afar but watch out!

Level 2
Suddenly a red ball appears. Taken from the original QBERT Atari game, this seemingly harmless ball makes things excedingly difficult. The Ball can fall off the stage but it will almost immediatly appear right back at the top. The little guy is persistant!

Level 3
The Ball and Coily remain but are now joined by a new enemy: Evil Qbert. Although Qbert will never admit it, the two share an uncanny resemblence. This purple look-a-like shares Qbert's special feet however instead of lighting tiles up, Evil Qbert turns the tiles back to their original color. How inconvenient!

Level 4
Qbert becomes his own worst enemy as his feet start playing tricks on him. He will change tiles back to their original tiles if he steps on them a second time. Even Evil Qbert is known to have a confused look on his face when this happens!

Level 5
Welcome to Qbert's worst nightmare. Let's just say Evil Qbert, Coily, and the Ball have brought friends. Enjoy!

To run the game:
Open cubes_java.pde (in the cubes_java folder) in processing and run it.
