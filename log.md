Spencer and Kyler:

* Created QBERT repository
* Added collaborators
* Added log.md
* Had a blast (somewhat. It's always a good time in APCS)

Kyler: Created enemies and character superclass. Planned out the interaction between the two and made many decisions about the overall plan of how the game will work and what we will sacrafice and change from the original game.
Reda: Planned game out with Kyler. Learned a lot of GUI but I seriously debating maybe using processing since this requires cubes. Will make the decision tonight and begin work on that.

     I am not really sure how to get cubes on GUI. I've learned a lot on GUI and I've found resources to make cubes but they aren't arrangable and I cannot manipulate certain faces of the cube. I think tomorrow in school I am going to take a look at processing as a better option. My plan right now is to create my own cube class with the top face containing special properties and to arrange the cubes in the QBERT arrangement. After the cubes I have to decide whether to create QBERT and enemies or to import their images. Kyler and I decided in class today that there will be two images of QBERT, one facing right and the other left. As QBERT bounces around he will face the appropriate direction. I am having trouble setting up processing on my laptop but since it's linux, I think troubleshooting should be simple. I found one potential gui cube creater but the package is weird to import into java. It's called ColorCube. Here are some of the classes online I found for cube creation:
